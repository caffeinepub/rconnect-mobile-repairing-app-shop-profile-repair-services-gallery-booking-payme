# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the top banner image area so no image appears above the sticky header on any page.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the TopBanner section from the global app layout so it is not rendered on any route.
- Ensure the header remains sticky at the top with no extra/blank spacing where the banner used to be (mobile and desktop).

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see the sticky header at the very top of every page with no banner image or empty banner space above it.
