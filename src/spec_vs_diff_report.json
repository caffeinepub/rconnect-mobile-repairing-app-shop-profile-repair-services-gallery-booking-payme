  "summary": "Implemented a new public /bookings route and added a navigation link to it. Added new public booking React Query hooks and a PublicBookingsPage. Backend changes are present but the diff excerpt does not show the required new public query methods. The logo asset update is not evidenced in the diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Replace the currently used Rconnect logo asset with the newly uploaded image while keeping the existing frontend logo path stable at `/assets/generated/rconnect-logo.dim_512x512.png`.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the logo path being used in Header, but there is no evidence that the static asset file `/assets/generated/rconnect-logo.dim_512x512.png` was updated/replaced in this change set.",

      "requirement": "If the backend previously restricted access to all-bookings data, add a new backend query method that allows fetching all bookings for the public page (and the frontend uses that method).",
      "reason": "Frontend calls `actor.getAllBookingsPublic()` and `actor.getBookingPublic()`, but the provided `backend/main.mo` diff excerpt does not show definitions for these public methods (content is truncated). Therefore their implementation cannot be verified from the diff summary.",

    {
      "description": "Backend `createBooking` explicitly opened to guests (unauthenticated callers) with a comment indicating guest access.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest did not ask to change booking creation authorization behavior; it focused on a logo asset swap and adding a public read-only bookings page.",
